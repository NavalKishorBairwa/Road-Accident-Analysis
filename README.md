# Road-Accident-Analysis
I'm excited to share
a report I recently created on Road Accident Analysis using Microsoft Excel.
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into data analysis and
visualization techniques.
 
Key Skills Learned:
 
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
 
- Pivot Tables and Charts
 
- Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation
 
 
Project Highlights:
 
I created a comprehensive dashboard that analyzed road accidents by different factors such as location, date, and cause.
 
Through data analysis, I was able to identify the top causes of accidents and the regions with the highest accident rates.
 
The dashboard included interactive features such as filters and slicers that allowed users to explore the data further.
 
I used pivot tables and charts to summarize the data and present it in a clear and concise manner.
 
I analyzed the total casualties that took place after the accident and
identified the type of vehicles involved in the accidents.
 
I also analyzed the type of road, time of the accident, road surface, location, and whether the accident occurred during the day or night.
 
By visualizing the data, I was able to present insights that could be used to improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents.
 
 
I'm thrilled with the outcome of this project and the skills I've developed along the way. Thank you for the opportunity to share my work with you. I would love to connect with other professionals in the data analysis field and discuss this further.
